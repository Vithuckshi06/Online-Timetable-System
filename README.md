# Online Timetable Management System
CSC3132 project - Web App Development

This is an Online Timetable Management System where the overall timetable of the department could be viewed by all students and lecturers enrolled. Also each batch of each course could view their seperate timetable.
The lecturer should be able to confirm or cancel a lecture slot in the system, also he/she should be able to reserve available slots for his modules. The system would notify these changes to the respective students.
